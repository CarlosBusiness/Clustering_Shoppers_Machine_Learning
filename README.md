# Clustering Mall Shoppers Using Machine Learning


Clustering is a form of machine learning techniques that allow you to find natural groupings and patterns in unlabeled data (also known as an unsupervised learning technique). Unlike many machine learning techniques, cluster analysis is not used for predicting the future outcome; however, it is a technique used for finding classes in large groups data. 


When looking in the context of business, many use cases involve the segmentation of a large number of customers in similar groups.
This repository will have many examples of clustering examples that I have performed and the different techniques that I am able to use.
